# String Calculator

This project is a simple string calculator that supports custom delimiters, multiple delimiters, and other advanced features. It is designed to handle string inputs and custom delimiters efficiently.

## Features

- **Default Delimiters**: Handles commas (`,`) and new lines (`\n`).
- **Custom Delimiters**: Supports user-defined delimiters, including special characters and multiple delimiters.
- **Negative Numbers**: Throws an error if any negative numbers are found, listing all of them.
- **Number Limits**: Ignores numbers greater than 1000, but includes numbers exactly equal to 1000.
- **Whitespace Delimiters**: Supports delimiters with spaces.
